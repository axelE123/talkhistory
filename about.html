    <h1>About TalkHistory.org</h1>
    <p>TalkHistory.org is a free oral history of Vancouver from the people who made it, in their very own words. Walk around Vancouver while you hear Vancouver’s real history from the people actually involved.</p>
    <p>Click the map icon for a preview of the Vancouver soundmap, with the first 4 oral history contributions.</p>
    <p>Did you know that Greenpeace first set sail on their first action from False Creek in 1971? Hear what one of the founding crew said about the experience.</p>
    <p>If you wish to nominate a time of particular historical importance to Vancouver or if you are a person involved in your community in Vancouver, and want an important Vancouver milestone mentioned, I’d love to hear from you.</p>
    <p>Please email <a href="mailto:davideirew@gmail.com">davideirew@gmail.com</a> with the subject 'Nominate Vancouver’s TalkHistory'.</p>
    <p>Come back soon for TalkHistory Vancouver, launching Summer 2024.</p>
    <p>Interested in making your own city sound map? Scroll down on this page for ideas on how to do this.</p>

    <h2>Want to Make a Sound Map for Your City? Here's How!</h2>
    <p><strong>First, READ everything you can about your city!</strong></p>
    <p>Books like *Hidden Vancouver* can be very helpful. Plaques around the city are also good starting points for what the City values, such as soldiers, war history, etc. Access museums and connect with people who specialize in lesser-known histories through those institutions.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Brainstorm myths and important events</strong> about your city that may be less publicized. Look into marginalized groups and their history. What heroes do you know about from each group? What stories haven't been told yet?</p>

    <p><strong>Reach out to groups</strong> that support underrepresented communities. For me, I connected with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Black Library in Vancouver</li>
      <li>Museum of Vancouver - Curator of Indigenous Collections, Prof Fortney</li>
      <li>Greenpeace members from their 1971 inaugural journey</li>
      <li>Hastings Mill Museum</li>
      <li>Vancouver Maritime Museum - Curator Duncan MacLeod mentored me for five months.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Ask for reasonable requests:</strong> I asked for 30 seconds to 1 minute of narration on an important, overlooked event in history. People can record this on their phones or meet in person if needed. Make sure to ask how they would like to be respectfully addressed and where their soundbite should be located on the map.</p>

    <p><strong>Suspend your knowledge of history</strong> and be open to hearing other perspectives on the same place. This project is about hearing voices that may have been sidelined in traditional histories.</p>

    <p><strong>Be patient</strong>: You may spend a lot of time chasing adults, so give yourself time to approach people and give them time to respond. Be sensitive to cultural norms and customs, such as Indigenous oral traditions.</p>

    <p><strong>Ask questions</strong>: Don’t hesitate to ask for clarification if you don’t understand something. Be prepared to feel uncomfortable at times as people may talk about things from different viewpoints or use unfamiliar terms.</p>

    <p><strong>Respect the stories</strong> you are told as precious. If you're unsure about how to handle a story, always ask for clarification to ensure you represent it correctly.</p>

    <p><strong>Embedding the map:</strong> Once you have your soundbites, embed them in a map. If possible, use Google Maps and add a sound layer. Here’s a helpful demo video by Richard Bryne: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVZZERSgGL4" target="_blank">Watch the tutorial</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Backup your work:</strong> Even small websites can fall victim to cyber attacks. Keep a clean file and update it regularly. I had to remake my site after a cyber attack, and if that happens to you, contact your host for help.</p>

    <p><strong>Launch your soundmap!</strong> Plan how you want to launch, whether it’s an online event or a media release. You can also write to thank speakers for their contributions. For me, connecting with the Ukrainian group I supported was important, as their experiences inspired my own journey.</p>

    <p>The free tour of Vancouver, complete with the spoken histories of marginalized and underrepresented people, literally puts their voices on the map.</p>

    <p><strong>Enjoy the journey!</strong> Now that you’ve done the work, enjoy seeing how many people engage with your soundmap. Keep the project fresh by adding new stories as you come across more speakers.</p>

    <p>Please tell me how you get on!</p>
