    <h1>About TalkHistory.org</h1>
    <p>TalkHistory.org is a free oral history of Vancouver from the people who made it, in their very own words. Walk round Vancouver while you hear Vancouver’s real history from the people actually involved.</p>
    <p>Click the map icon for a preview of the Vancouver soundmap, with the first 4 oral history contributions.</p>
    <p>Did you know that Greenpeace first set sail on their first action from False Creek in 1971? Hear what one of the founding crew said about the experience.</p>
    <p>If you wish to nominate a time of particular historical importance to Vancouver or if you are a person involved in your community in Vancouver, and want an important Vancouver milestone mentioned, I’d love to hear from you.</p>
    <p>Please email <a href="mailto:davideirew@gmail.com">davideirew@gmail.com</a> with the subject 'Nominate Vancouver’s TalkHistory'.</p>
    <p>Come back soon for TalkHistory Vancouver, launching Summer 2024.</p>
